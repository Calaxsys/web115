          <ol>
            <li><p><strong>WEB115 Web Markup and Scripting</strong> - I needed this class for my degree, but I also wanted a structured class to help me learn some more skills I may not know.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>CTI130 OS and Device Foundations</strong> - This class was also required for my degree, but I love the opportunity to dive into the inner workings of computers.</p></li>
          </ol>
