      <h2>Contract</h2>
      <p>
        I, <a href="introduction.html">Christopher D. Troublefield</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my WEB115, Professor von Briesen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signed: <i>Christopher D. Troublefield, 19 January 2025</i>
