        A brief intro about me: My name is Chris Troublefield, I have spent many years teaching myself the proper ways to write code, now I am currently enrolled in full-stack programming at CPCC. I hope to achieve my degree, so I am able to find work in the tech industry, as well as to continue my education after.
